Inpainting With Local Binary Constraints

The inlpe_with_LBC.c  allows to  perform image inpainting with homogeneous diffusion using Local Binary Patterns as additional constraints for unknown pixels around inpainting mask locations. 

The nlpe_with_LBC.c allows to create an image mask suitable for inpainting with Local Binary Constraints.
